# Membership

## How can I contribute to The LAO and become a member?

Membership in The LAO is currently limited to accredited investors, as defined under U.S. law. The total number of members will be capped at a maximum of 100 members.

Members will be permitted to join The LAO through The LAO's DApp starting on or about mid-February 2020 (there will be a public announcement shortly).

Once open, members will have the opportunity to contribute Ether to The LAO by purchasing tokens representing an ownership in The LAO ("LAO Tokens").

Tokens will be sold in blocks. Each block of LAO Tokens will be sold for 120 ETH and provide a member with 1% of the voting rights in The LAO, along with 1% pro rata rights to any proceeds from investments.

Each member will be permitted to purchase up to nine blocks of LAO Tokens (or 9% in total) for a maximum purchase price of \1,080 (ETH).

The sale will be denominated in USD but settled in Ether. To calculate the amount of Ether necessary to complete a subscription, The LAO will rely on a real time oracle feed provided by [Chainlink](https://chain.link/).

## Are The LAO Tokens securities?

The LAO Tokens have not been approved or disapproved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission in the United States, or any other global regulatory authority.

## Can I contribute Bitcoin, Dai, or other assets to The LAO?

All contributions are currently only limited to Ether, unless the members agree otherwise.

## Why is membership in The LAO limited to accredited investors and 100 members?

As noted above, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or equivalent government bodies in other jurisdictions have not determined whether membership interests in The LAO (represented as tokens) are securities.

In the abundance of caution, the limits in membership and accreditation status are put in place to:

- comply with U.S. securities law;
- prevent any one party from controlling a disproportionate amount of The LAO; and
- limit the risk of look through issues for The LAO Members that are organized as funds or other legal entities.

## Are there any other requirements needed to become a member?

To contribute Ether to The LAO, members will need to go through accredited investor, anti-money laundering ("AML"), Know Your Customer ("KYC"), and Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") checks as defined under U.S. law and as discussed further below. A joining member will need to deposit a sufficient amount of Ether from the member's Ethereum address in order to complete the membership process.

A member will also need to submit sufficient information to verify the potential member's identity for AML, KYC, and OFAC checks, including:

- uploading a passport or a state issued license;
- providing a social security number or Tax ID; and
- providing proof of the member's primary residence.

Accredited investors include:

- Individuals who have an annual income exceeding $200K or a married couple that has joint income exceeding $300K in the two most recent years and have a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level this year.
- Individuals who have a net worth that exceeds \$1 million (excluding the individual's primary residence).

With respect to legal entities:

- Funds and trusts, with total assets in excess of \$5 million, which were not formed specifically to purchase the subject securities, whose purchase is directed by someone who has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters to evaluate the merits and risks of the prospective investment.
- Any entity in which all of the equity owners are accredited investors.

In order to register and validate members, a potential member will need to supply The LAO with sufficient information to assess whether the member meets these legal requirements, which will be confirmed by The LAO's service provider.
