## Are there any fees are associated with The LAO?

As noted in these FAQs, The LAO's organizational documents expressly contemplate the use of a service provider to help facilitate, on behalf of the members, activity by The LAO. As compensation for these services, the service provider will initially charge the following fees.

| ---- | :-------------------------: |
| 1    |             2%              |
| 2    |           1.6807%           |

All fees are payable on a quarterly basis to the service provider and will begin to accrue once The LAO launches. Members have the right to terminate the services of the service provider at any time.

## Does The LAO charge a carry?

Notably, because The LAO is member managed, it does not have any general partner. No member of The LAO or the service provider will be entitled to a carry, unless otherwise agreed to by the members.
